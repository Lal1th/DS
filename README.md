## Features

- Predicts the share of jurisdiction emissions covered for the year 2025.
- Implements two regression models: Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Visualizes predictions using scatter plots and residual plots.
- Evaluates model performance using various metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ²).

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data

The dataset includes historical emissions data for various jurisdictions from 2019 to 2024, with the following key columns:

- `Share of jurisdiction emissions covered`
- `2019`
- `2020`
- `2021`
- `2022`
- `2023`
- `2024`

Please ensure that the data is properly formatted and preprocessed before running the models.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
